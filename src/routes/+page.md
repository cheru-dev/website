Hello, world!
=============

I'm **Cheru Berhanu**: a programmer, violinist, and high school student based in Vermont.

I spend the majority of my free time programming for my local [robotics team](https://essexrobotics.org),
leading a [coding club](https://essexhacks.org/) at my school, 
working on small software projects, and practicing violin.

You can find me on GitHub as [recursiveforte](https://github.com/recursiveforte) and email me at [cheru@cheru.dev](mailto:cheru@cheru.dev).
