Hello, world!
=============

### About
I'm **Cheru Berhanu**: a programmer, violinist, and high school student based in Vermont.

I primarily enjoy working with robotics and web development (full-stack), and I also do a bit of systems programming.

### Things I've Done
#### [HiveMind Robotics](https://essexrobotics.org)
FIRST robotics team I'm a part of

I help program a control system in Kotlin to run in both autonomous and driver-controlled modes for competitions.

I also made the website!
It's written in NextJS using TypeScript, and comes with a homemade markdown-based CMS using PocketBase.

#### [tick](https://github.com/recursiveforte/tick)
A terminal metronome written in Go, using the Bubble Tea framework!  

I use this regularly to keep myself in tempo when practicing violin, and it's one of my favorite small projects.
